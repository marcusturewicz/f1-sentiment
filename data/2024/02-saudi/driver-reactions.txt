time,reaction
00:00,"yeah the car was working really well of"
00:01,"course that last thing was a bit longer"
00:03,"than we initially would have liked but"
00:05,"with the safety car you had to pit and"
00:07,"from there on was just about managing"
00:09,"the the ties to the end to make sure"
00:10,"that the ties would would last but I do"
00:13,"have to say that um the last few laps"
00:15,"when I was catching the the back markers"
00:17,"my tires were starting to be a bit cold"
00:18,"and it was quite tricky like with the"
00:20,"grip was very easy to to have big"
00:22,"moments so I had to take my time to get"
00:24,"through the back markers and once I"
00:25,"clear them again I I could just settle"
00:27,"in and you know around here with all the"
00:30,"being so close easy to make a mistake"
00:32,"and of course I wanted to to prevent that"
00:33,"it was a strong strong result for"
00:36,"the team the whole team has done an"
00:37,"amazing job the stops were amazing it"
00:39,"was a bit of a shame you know that we"
00:41,"got compromised with that early safety"
00:42,"car and with the penalty um but it was"
00:45,"overall um a good solid race for the whole team"
00:47,"I don't think there was"
00:49,"anything uh to do better today on the"
00:52,"medium we struggle a bit more than we"
00:54,"expected on the beginning of the hard we"
00:56,"struggled a bit more than we expected"
00:58,"towards the end we were fast because we"
01:00,"we obviously did the fastest lap in the"
01:02,"last lap which was nice uh uh we got"
01:05,"helped a little bit with the DRS but all"
01:06,"in all I felt good with the car there"
01:08,"are just few things that we need to uh"
01:11,"look had some weird vibrations but apart from that all good"
01:13,"I think that was was"
01:15,"the most we could have done um so"
01:17,"leaving jeda very happy to be honest"
01:19,"um yeah got past Fernando early on got"
01:23,"stuck behind L for a long time and um"
01:25,"then once he pitted I was was okay but"
01:28,"um yeah still definitely showed some"
01:30,"some things that we need to to improve a"
01:32,"little bit but um yeah I think that was"
01:35,"definitely the most we could do at the moment"
01:36,"I feel great I feel"
01:38,"uh yeah a little more uncomfortable now"
01:41,"but uh uh no the race was good and uh"
01:45,"the Bas was was better than bin still I"
01:48,"think we are faster on qualifying than"
01:50,"the race but we could fight with the"
01:52,"McLarens today and the Mercedes I think"
01:55,"Red Bull and Ferrari still one one step"
01:57,"ahead but um yeah I was comfortable with"
02:00,"a car I'm happy with today's race"
02:02,"right now it's we we're fluctuating in"
02:04,"performance quite a lot um you know"
02:06,"we've seen potential in the car um but"
02:09,"unfortunately these last two weekends we"
02:11,"haven't really shown it when it's"
02:12,"mattered so we need to understand why"
02:14,"that is and what we need to do um but as"
02:17,"we've seen it is very close between"
02:18,"ourselves McLaren Aston and Ferrari um"
02:22,"we just need to be on top of it"
02:23,"physically it was a really difficult"
02:25,"race um especially at the end when I had"
02:27,"the two uh guys on soft behind me"
02:30,"and I had to basically push flat out and"
02:32,"it was um yeah mentally difficult race"
02:34,"as expected and then physically I was"
02:36,"struggling too um but great fun out"
02:38,"there just generally this weekend how"
02:40,"proud are you of your performance what"
02:42,"you've displayed and how valuable is"
02:44,"this you know for your career going"
02:45,"forward yeah I think I put a good"
02:47,"showing for myself which is the main"
02:49,"thing right um difficult circumstances"
02:52,"you know not a lot of laps on track but"
02:54,"I think we maximized everything today"
02:56,"I mean we took a little bit of a gamble to"
02:58,"try to go along on the mediums and Hope"
02:59,"there was a safety car or something but"
03:01,"uh but it never came so we gave it a"
03:04,"good shot um we could have just boxed in"
03:07,"the beginning with everyone else but I"
03:09,"thought we'd try something a little bit"
03:10,"different and uh could have worked it"
03:13,"didn't but uh that's how it did"
03:15,"sometimes so I'm happy I think the"
03:16,"performance of the car was good"
03:18,"we tried the plan was to go long um and we we"
03:20,"tried our best to you know hope him for"
03:23,"um VSC or something but it uh just never"
03:27,"came to us but uh it was worth the"
03:28,"Gamble"
03:30,"um unfortunately went backwards a little"
03:32,"bit or at least lost a place but but"
03:35,"gave it everything and um that was the"
03:37,"best result I can get"
03:40,"I feel happy um obviously because scoring points it's"
03:42,"quite tough these days and uh it take"
03:45,"takes one of the top five cars to drop"
03:46,"out which obviously happened today and"
03:48,"we managed to capitalize on that I think"
03:51,"a very good strategy from the team um to"
03:54,"split the cars in safety car then good"
03:56,"pace for myself and uh good work"
03:59,"obviously from Kevin and you know who"
04:00,"was playing the team game um helping me"
04:01,"a lot and in my race and you know that"
04:04,"was the foundation to be able to score points"
04:05,"we didn't score any points so it"
04:08,"was a bit frustrating but um yeah I mean"
04:11,"didn't really have a straight line speed"
04:13,"had front wing damage as well um so it"
04:16,"was tough I think we had a better race"
04:17,"car than than it showed today a bit"
04:20,"frustrating but we'll focus for for Australia"
04:22,"didn't mean to to have contact"
04:25,"the wall sort of comes back at you and I"
04:27,"I just judge it badly and uh we had we"
04:30,"had contact unfortunately so um I mean"
04:33,"it's yeah it is what it is but we showed"
04:36,"good Pace unfortunately I had another"
04:39,"another penalty with with sonoda so yeah"
04:43,"uh that's not not a great day for me of"
04:44,"course but then I think I made up for it"
04:47,"with uh the effort on keeping everyone"
04:51,"uh behind to to create a gap for Nik to"
04:54,"pit and uh he scored a point today"
04:56,"it's been um you know a very opportun"
04:58,"opportunistic race race you know on our"
05:00,"side I think we we maximize the"
05:01,"potential and probably more um we were"
05:04,"up to P1 at some stage um I think even"
05:07,"P0 virtually um with all the chaos that"
05:10,"there was and we were trying to you know"
05:12,"to get position you know from that and"
05:14,"and we did so uh which was quite good"
05:16,"you know from the start to up to there"
05:18,"but unfortunately not not quick enough"
05:20,"yet we are not quick enough yet"
05:21,"I don't think it was too bad um a good first 35"
05:23,"laps a good start um I think I just"
05:27,"struggled to to find the potential at"
05:28,"the end last"
05:30,"last 12 to 15 laps or so um so yeah"
05:33,"little bits to go through there at the"
05:34,"end I think I was starting to explore"
05:36,"that potential but it just took too long"
05:38,"to to realize that it was there"
05:40,"there was a couple of mistakes myself as well"
05:42,"but uh also struggled with a grap um"
05:46,"obviously there's a bit of um yeah messy"
05:51,"Midfield but yeah if it's normal uh I"
05:54,"think um we just G path through got path"
05:58,"through so you know I let the cars a"
06:00,"couple of cars behind and that was my"
06:02,"mistake uh but the same time yeah was"
06:05,"pretty difficult to handle it"
06:07,"tough weekend um I think on you know the only"
06:10,"thing that's probably keeping me a"
06:11,"little bit uh optimistic now is we did"
06:14,"find a few things so that's that's"
06:17,"positive when you know that cuz you I've"
06:20,"driven a long time I know when things"
06:21,"don't feel quite right but um on one"
06:24,"hand it's nice to find a few things but"
06:26,"on another it meant that it was a pretty"
06:28,"painful week can so um that's that's"
06:31,"obviously"
06:32,"frustrating uh and the race yeah there"
06:34,"was uh it was tough I think coming into"
06:36,"it we knew it would be tough then we had"
06:38,"a a slow pit stop and then a few laps"
06:39,"from the end I uh I ate a to a bit too"
06:42,"much curve in turn one and had a spin"
06:44,"but um that kind of summed up the the weekends"
06:46,"tough race we we didn't have"
06:49,"the pace that we were already hoping for"
06:51,"and what we calculated so ultimately"
06:54,"especially on the hot compound we"
06:56,"couldn't make it make it really to work"
06:58,"and couldn't make a good pace and that"
07:01,"was the biggest issue we we tried to go"
07:02,"for the soft in the end but it was"
07:05,"better but that we had stop"
07:07,"everything was going well difficult race at the"
07:09,"beginning managing a lot the the engine"
07:11,"temp but then very fast pace on the"
07:13,"median considering how much I have to"
07:15,"lift off for the tires or for the"
07:17,"temperature but yeah after the piss"
07:19,"double unfortunately it's done uh"
07:21,"frustrating of course it happens already"
07:24,"day twice for us is a team we need to"
07:27,"improve that's clear and uh yeah the"
07:29,"race was basically gone after that"
07:31,"yeah I just touched the uh inside left uh"
07:34,"turn 22 so um just a mistake yeah I mean"
07:38,"it's it's definitely not our weekend um"
07:41,"we lost the sixth gear on the on the"
07:43,"formation lap and uh yeah basically had"
07:47,"a gear gearbox issue um on the formation"
07:50,"lap which meant we we had to retire uh"
07:53,"from some damage on the car after"
07:54,"qualifying yesterday as well which"
07:56,"probably cost us a Q2 so it's just uh"
07:58,"it's been been too difficult day for the"
08:00,"team and just feeling for everyone we'll"
08:02,"be still going through a very difficult"
08:12,"time"
