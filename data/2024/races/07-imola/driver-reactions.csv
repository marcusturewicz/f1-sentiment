time,reaction
00:00,"yeah it was very tricky at the end I"
00:01,"think at the start the mediums were good"
00:03,"I I had very good Pace there but on the"
00:05,"hot tires seemed like they were not"
00:06,"working on our car I I never really got"
00:09,"them you know to fire up and then of"
00:11,"course you know the longer you do the"
00:12,"stand the worse it gets and the last 10"
00:14,"15 laps for me were extremely difficult"
00:17,"it's like driving on ice and I could see"
00:18,"of course Lando closing in and um yeah"
00:21,"the last few laps I was pushing flat out"
00:23,"while being you know for my feeling on"
00:25,"eyes it was so so difficult to be"
00:27,"consistent but of course very happy that"
00:29,"we still won"
00:30,"I mean it was just too much too much to"
00:33,"do I got close but then as soon as you"
00:35,"get close the temp the tires just start"
00:37,"to overheat you lose a lot of downforce"
00:38,"and grip and takes a couple laps just to"
00:41,"kind of understand how to avoid some of"
00:43,"that and how to drive in those"
00:46,"conditions once I understood that it was"
00:48,"the last lap and then I caught but it"
00:49,"was just too late so I mean I caught"
00:52,"like what 10 seconds or something in"
00:54,"probably 16 17 laps so was a good effort um little too late"
00:59,"of course I want uh"
01:01,"more and I wish I was we were on the"
01:04,"first step of the podium today however"
01:07,"it's the best we could do today I think"
01:09,"uh looking back at the weekend I'm a bit"
01:11,"more optimistic and a bit more positive"
01:13,"compared to where to how I was feeling"
01:16,"yesterday for sure we need to keep on"
01:18,"working try and obviously maximizing the"
01:21,"potential and uh and"
01:24,"uh thought he was"
01:27,"sliding um maximizing the potential of"
01:30,"the car uh which for now there's still"
01:33,"some to uh to unlock uh is still"
01:35,"relatively new uh the upgrade on the car"
01:37,"so uh there are some things we can do to uh to to improve"
01:40,"yeah I think you know"
01:41,"the whole weekend has been really strong"
01:44,"for both the team and myself I think"
01:47,"I've been confident from the first lap"
01:49,"of practice and you know had a really"
01:51,"good qualifying uh just a shame about"
01:53,"the penalty cuz I think it's"
01:55,"unfortunately limited what we could have"
01:57,"done um so yeah I think we had a good"
02:00,"strategy to get in front of one of the"
02:02,"Ferraris I tried my best to get the"
02:04,"second one but uh it's just so tough to"
02:07,"overtake that you know you spend a"
02:09,"couple laps trying you overheat the ties"
02:11,"quickly and then it's uh it's game over"
02:13,"so um yeah I think that was the most we had today"
02:15,"well on my side I just"
02:17,"struggled uh to be honest all weekend uh"
02:20,"after qualifying we found a couple of um"
02:22,"couple of issues with the with a car"
02:24,"that probably hold us back today a bit"
02:26,"and uh and was not a very strong weekend"
02:28,"at home here in from the the defos now"
02:31,"we need to have a look at how we can"
02:32,"solve them and and make a step forward"
02:34,"for Monaco at the same time when you"
02:36,"look at Charles I think if we would have"
02:39,"started in front the race bace is not"
02:41,"bad at all it's just we need to find something in qualifying"
02:42,"no I mean I had"
02:44,"George ahead of me at the beginning and"
02:46,"then I was always I never really felt I"
02:47,"could see people and I was chasing so I"
02:49,"didn't really feel like I was alone um I"
02:52,"was just pushing trying to close"
02:55,"whatever Gap was up ahead of me but um"
02:58,"yeah we just we we don't have the pace"
02:59,"the others at the moment but we are eing slowly eeking closer"
03:02,"yeah not not too"
03:05,"sure um the reason need to talk with the"
03:08,"team but I think we we're slightly"
03:09,"concerned with the"
03:10,"tire um at the end of the day as a team"
03:13,"we got one extra point obviously lost"
03:14,"the position to Lewis but it's not"
03:17,"something I'm going to be talking about"
03:18,"tonight to be honest so uh yeah it was a bit of a lonely race for us"
03:21,"um we risked"
03:23,"it we knew that it was a very risky"
03:25,"strategy and and the teams were not"
03:27,"favoring that strategy but we we were"
03:29,"dreaming a bit with the safety card at"
03:31,"the right point for us and uh also I"
03:34,"think it was really bad um going off I"
03:37,"was playing around with the balance to"
03:39,"try and and protect a little bit the"
03:41,"rear axle and then I just went straight"
03:43,"into turn 16 and uh yeah that meant that"
03:47,"um I I feel like I pick up some damage"
03:50,"and um that compromised also the race"
03:52,"because that put us I lost like six"
03:54,"seven seconds and that put me really close to to the people uh behind"
03:56,"yeah we"
04:00,"were hoping for a safety car um and we"
04:03,"were staying out very long time and then"
04:05,"uh yeah at the end it was fun to pass some cars"
04:07,"I was start compromised a"
04:09,"little bit race but um yeah still happy"
04:12,"that we able to score points at least in"
04:14,"front of the well our home Grand Prix"
04:18,"and uh yeah it wasn't easy managing like"
04:20,"more than 50 laps with a hard tire but"
04:23,"uh yeah I think I well on to the team and yeah positive"
04:25,"yeah obviously we got"
04:27,"under cut by Yuki so that was one"
04:29,"position lost um and obviously you know"
04:32,"czecho was coming through the Red Bull"
04:33,"there's no holding him back and also"
04:36,"Lance you know with much fresher tires"
04:37,"on a on a different strategy so uh yeah"
04:41,"we we just I think frankly didn't have"
04:43,"quite enough Pace we were missing a"
04:44,"little bit and also the strategy the"
04:46,"early stop made made life quite hard it"
04:49,"was a long final stint um and it was a"
04:52,"struggle you know to find the a good"
04:54,"Harmony and and Rhythm but uh yeah otherwise clean race"
04:57,"yeah I think we had"
04:59,"a decent day uh didn't really get"
05:02,"anything uh for free in in terms of uh"
05:06,"cars ahead having problems so uh p12 for"
05:08,"us uh we really earned that it was um"
05:12,"yeah overtaking people on track and uh"
05:14,"really fighting for it so uh felt like a"
05:17,"good race but we just started too far back"
05:19,"I don't know the facts yet but"
05:20,"honestly from my side nothing felt like"
05:23,"it went wrong in terms of you kind of"
05:25,"know if you botch it with the kind of"
05:27,"the way you drop the clutch and you got"
05:29,"a pretty good idea when it's kind of"
05:30,"your fault um I didn't feel like"
05:33,"anything went wrong so yeah I mean let's"
05:37,"let's wait and see but anyway as a team"
05:38,"we got to we got to figure it out and we just like like consistency there"
05:40,"I think"
05:43,"we we deserved in Miami to to be scoring"
05:45,"a point um we don't deserve today to to"
05:47,"be scoring it I think we we struggle too"
05:50,"much with the pace uh in general but"
05:52,"also the straight line speed you know we"
05:53,"are not able to attack or defend a"
05:56,"certain stage of the race and that"
05:57,"costed us quite a lot um so yeah no"
06:00,"points uh this race we will uh you know"
06:04,"try and analyze and understand you know"
06:06,"what we can do better for this race and"
06:07,"uh hopefully uh you know we can have another goal next week"
06:10,"yeah it feels not"
06:12,"not too bad I think uh where we finish"
06:14,"is kind of the speed unfortunately but"
06:16,"uh the race made hard kind of hard soft"
06:19,"hard medium worked but yeah praying for"
06:22,"a bit safety at the end but nothing"
06:24,"really happened at the end but the race"
06:26,"was quite a lot action going on uh yeah"
06:29,"it was quite lot tough fight but then I"
06:30,"had one time going off into tonight"
06:33,"getting pushed wi by EST buom I was"
06:35,"quite surprised there was no further action after that but yeah"
06:36,"uh yeah we'll"
06:39,"have to review I mean um first stage of"
06:42,"the race I'm within couple seconds of uh"
06:45,"lenberg and the Yuki I think Danny Rick"
06:48,"is taken out of me and then we finish"
06:50,"mes of though so uh uh yeah not a good"
06:54,"afternoon and um we'll have to review um what we missed out"
06:57,"it was a weird one um"
07:00,"you know tried to start on the hard um"
07:02,"the tire really got damaged early on in"
07:04,"the race and um just trying to hang on"
07:06,"on that stint do some defending try and"
07:08,"hurt some other people's races um to"
07:11,"hopefully help you know later on and"
07:14,"then we went to that second s and just"
07:15,"blue flag after blue flag and um lots of"
07:18,"dirty air and you know we have we having"
07:20,"these big swings of performance and it"
07:22,"was all just coming from you know the"
07:24,"the temperature of the tire um we found"
07:26,"a bit of Clean Air the performance would"
07:28,"come get into the dirty and we'd"
07:29,"immediately start to struggle so"
07:33,"um don't really know what to say I uh I"
07:37,"just did my best to you know take over the lap as best I could"
07:39,"we tried"
07:40,"something with the strategy today we"
07:42,"stopped really early uh which I think"
07:44,"it's good to try but the last thing was"
07:46,"too long like the last 10 laps uh tires"
07:49,"just dropped dropped away and uh it was"
07:52,"bit more like ice skating than then racing"
07:53,"I mean we need to to wait and see"
07:55,"all the data that we gathered today and"
07:58,"um and ask the team you know what what"
08:00,"they they saw different between the two"
08:02,"cars we opted for to set up different uh"
08:05,"in my car and uh yeah let's see if we we"
08:08,"find a direction for the next few races"
08:10,"it was a tough weekend obviously"
08:11,"qualifying dictates everything here it"
08:13,"will be the same in Monaco so we need to"
08:16,"um do that perfect Saturday that you"
08:18,"know obviously makes uh things easier for Sunday"
08:20,"yes I was hoping for a a"
08:23,"safety car and then a kind of a NASCAR"
08:25,"sty W Me by kind of thing but nothing"
08:27,"really came and then we fell to LPS back"
08:30,"so after the penalty so so not perfect"
08:33,"um pretty much out the pit Lane so as"
08:35,"soon as I got up to speed and breaks"
08:37,"into turn one and too much vibration and"
08:42,"uh the wheel nut wasn't on"
08:45,"um it wasn't like it was totally off but"
08:48,"it was just a little bit of free play um"
08:51,"so safe to come back but not not safe"
08:53,"enough to race"
