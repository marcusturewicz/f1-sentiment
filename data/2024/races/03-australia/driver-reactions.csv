time,reaction
00:00,"yeah I can just tell you I'm extremely"
00:01,"happy and not only because of these last"
00:03,"two weeks but because of how difficult"
00:05,"this year it's been so far you know as I"
00:07,"said on the radio a bit of a roller"
00:09,"coaster you start the year with the bad"
00:13,"news of the non-renewal and a bit"
00:15,"thinking okay what's next in my life uh"
00:17,"and then you prepare yourself you go"
00:19,"training you do your winter testing you"
00:22,"arrive to the first race and boom h a"
00:23,"good Podium that sets the season going"
00:26,"gets the season going and then suddenly"
00:28,"the appendix"
00:30,"the the unknown of when am I going to be"
00:33,"back am I going to be back in full form"
00:35,"how long it's going to take me to to get"
00:37,"back up to speed and and confident and"
00:40,"then suddenly you come back and win"
00:41,"first and second was the best we could"
00:43,"do this weekend so on that I'm very"
00:44,"happy on my own performance I'm not"
00:47,"extremely happy in qualifying I didn't"
00:48,"do a great job I was starting further"
00:51,"back than what I would have hoped for uh"
00:53,"in the race my second stint wasn't great"
00:55,"I had a lot of front graining my last"
00:57,"stint was really good but that was too"
00:58,"late to uh"
01:00,"to do anything and and caros has been on"
01:02,"it the whole weekend so um"
01:04,"congratulations to him he deserves it"
01:06,"probably wasn't expecting to have the"
01:07,"pace we did today I think we expected"
01:09,"good Pace but maybe not to keep up with"
01:11,"Charles and honestly I would say our"
01:12,"Pace was probably a bit better than"
01:13,"Charles today they undercut us uh they"
01:16,"got the upper hand on this one so maybe"
01:18,"we kind"
01:19,"of can review our decisions and and what"
01:22,"we tried to achieve but uh you're always"
01:24,"in a tricky spot when you're in in this position"
01:26,"yeah I think definitely we we"
01:28,"we a bit quicker than we expected"
01:30,"um yeah when we we could hang with the"
01:32,"Ferraris that was uh a positive surprise"
01:35,"and obviously Max went out early but um"
01:38,"yeah was surprised czecho wasn't a bit"
01:40,"quicker so um yeah good result happy"
01:43,"with that and uh I think you know the"
01:45,"fact that we were able to stay pretty"
01:47,"close to Ferrari was a a great sign"
01:50,"uh we just struggled to put the the car in"
01:52,"the window I think uh the first instinct"
01:56,"I was very re limited the we were trying"
02:00,"to protect the front but we overdid it"
02:03,"and uh and then going onto the second"
02:05,"and third thing we just decked off the"
02:08,"that front left tire which uh yeah it"
02:10,"was an ideal unfortunately"
02:12,"yeah it was obviously a very difficult weekend for"
02:14,"us in terms of pace so yeah the race we"
02:16,"were lucky with the safety car at the"
02:18,"beginning with Luis and then uh um the"
02:21,"piss stops were were great as well so"
02:22,"thanks to the strategy and a little bit"
02:24,"of luck obviously we maximize the points"
02:25,"but uh we cannot forget that the the the"
02:28,"pace was difficult the whole weekend"
02:30,"yeah it was uh I mean a pretty lonely"
02:33,"race but uh good to pick up some points"
02:35,"the pace was there uh from already from"
02:37,"last two races I would say for sure this"
02:39,"race was probably probably the best out"
02:42,"of uh out of three um so yeah also we we"
02:47,"will check the reason why we were"
02:49,"performing well here and um hopefully"
02:51,"also we can continue like this"
02:53,"performing uh also next races or worse yeah"
02:55,"obviously first VC helped me you"
02:57,"know it was a cheap stop but then two"
03:00,"times was quite practical after both my"
03:02,"stop I came out and kind of it's quite"
03:05,"you know awkward for the car that's on"
03:07,"track when a car comes out of the pit"
03:08,"Lane because we sort of park it you know"
03:10,"and the closing speed is very big and uh"
03:13,"first time I kind of overtook Daniel"
03:14,"that way and the second time I took Alex"
03:16,"that way and I'm sure they were both"
03:18,"pretty uh yeah unhappy about that but"
03:21,"you know that kind of made our race"
03:22,"today and that together with the vstc"
03:25,"and everything and the teamwork so uh very happy"
03:27,"it's good I mean we got both"
03:29,"casts the points good teamwork once"
03:31,"again um obviously it didn't help me"
03:34,"with the virtual safety car the first"
03:36,"one but uh on the flips side it help Nik"
03:38,"so we could uh you know get him back in"
03:40,"the battle and uh fantastic uh day for"
03:43,"us to uh to get three points here um"
03:46,"after"
03:47,"qualifying you know decent but not not"
03:50,"great um just super happy with today"
03:53,"a bit disappointed I don't think we had the pace"
03:54,"today and and we were kind of falling"
03:56,"away from the group we were racing so we"
03:58,"kept fitting early to keep us in the mix"
04:01,"um get on some fresh ties and try and"
04:02,"close the gap again and by the end of"
04:04,"the race the last 10 laps it it it paid"
04:08,"our price and we uh we dropped back so"
04:11,"um frustrating just struggled with the"
04:13,"tires um graining and um couldn't drive"
04:18,"as quickly as other people without weing the ti"
04:19,"yeah I I kind of knew that what's"
04:22,"done is done and try to make the most of"
04:24,"today and even obviously it's nice that"
04:27,"I there was moments in the race where I"
04:28,"did have pace and I was was able to show"
04:30,"okay I can still get some good stints in"
04:33,"there but um it was still good to get"
04:36,"the laps and yeah there's there's things"
04:39,"through the race where I'll"
04:42,"um Mark like we have uh we have let's"
04:46,"say a button on the wheel that I can"
04:47,"like use as a reference to say oh that"
04:49,"lap I felt something there so you know"
04:51,"like there was um I'm not giving away"
04:54,"secret information but it's just things"
04:55,"to I remember to tell the engineers"
04:57,"after so there's a few points through"
04:59,"the through the race that I marked let's"
05:00,"say and yeah so it's good it's good to"
05:03,"get the the understanding the data"
05:06,"Gathering and all that um obviously the"
05:09,"weekend I would have loved to have gone better"
05:10,"we started 17th finished 13th"
05:13,"we tried with the strategy try to put"
05:16,"ourself in a at some stage of the race"
05:19,"in a decent position in case there is"
05:21,"any red flag and uh"
05:23,"we in a way feel like we we did the the"
05:27,"best we uh the best we could with the"
05:29,"package we had but uh you know we were"
05:31,"just talking about it last year I was"
05:33,"fighting with caros for"
05:35,"P4 this year he wins the race and we fighting in 13th"
05:37,"it's not great obviously"
05:39,"we know we have work to do on those and"
05:42,"um yeah it's it's frustrating because"
05:44,"it's I think we had a good Pace Good"
05:46,"Start should have ideally got points"
05:49,"today with the performance we had so"
05:51,"yeah it's tough but um yeah we we"
05:54,"obviously haven't haven't solved the"
05:55,"issues yet we have so that's what we need to uh keep working on"
05:57,"actually we"
06:00,"was together with this the guys the pace"
06:03,"and I think uh beside from that we had a"
06:06,"let's say a better Pace compar to the"
06:08,"alpins like we expected and then"
06:11,"starting at the back of the train it's"
06:12,"difficult to just gain positions"
06:14,"everybody is in the train and was tricky"
06:17,"to overtake but Pace was Pace was okay"
06:19,"in general like we expected but nothing surprisingly bad or more"
06:21,"we were running"
06:24,"on for possible points uh today we were"
06:26,"in front of uh of Kevin we're fighting"
06:29,"with Al I was in front of uh of Nico as"
06:32,"well so you know we were going to be in"
06:34,"the mix you know for that 9 10th 11th"
06:36,"position um it was going to be a fun"
06:38,"race but unfortunately cut short uh with that issue with the tier off"
06:41,"yeah I'm"
06:43,"okay um really don't know what happened"
06:45,"to be honest I was half a second behind"
06:47,"Fernando on the entry of the corner and"
06:50,"then suddenly you know before the Apex I"
06:52,"was right in his gearbox and"
06:55,"um and lost the car ran wide and um just"
06:59,"unfortunately the wall was well Ram W"
07:02,"hit the wall and then it was obviously a"
07:04,"dramatic um few seconds after that but"
07:09,"yeah disappointing end to uh a difficult race"
07:12,"uh well I didn't feel it it just"
07:15,"went in one go I didn't feel it coming"
07:17,"um definitely frustrating cuz you know I"
07:19,"was so early in the race you still I was"
07:21,"hoping to be able to to progress"
07:22,"forwards and um on a different strategy"
07:25,"to everyone and um but these things happen"
07:29,"in the car from my side already"
07:32,"when I had that moment inory it was very"
07:34,"weird why that happened because you"
07:36,"weren't really pushing you just easing"
07:37,"into the race you know settling in but"
07:40,"um of course once I got out of the car"
07:42,"you look into the data and um basically"
07:44,"what happened was from the from the when"
07:46,"the lights went off uh the right rear"
07:48,"brake stuck on and um yeah it didn't"
07:51,"cool so it just kept on being warmer and"
07:52,"warmer giving me really weird"
07:54,"instabilities and then of course it"
07:55,"caught"
07:58,"fire"
