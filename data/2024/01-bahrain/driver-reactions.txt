time,reaction
00:00,"these kind of days they don't happen"
00:01,"that often where everything just seems"
00:02,"to be perfect the car just feel spot on"
00:05,"you know you don't really have any big"
00:06,"complaints so that was very enjoyable"
00:09,"there's a lot more to learn for sure I"
00:10,"mean it's natur everyone also today in"
00:12,"the race with the tires like how they"
00:13,"are behaving and uh yeah for sure we'll"
00:16,"we'll look into detail um you know what"
00:18,"we can try and and improve but I also"
00:20,"know last year this was a very strong"
00:22,"track for us there will be tracks are"
00:24,"probably will be a bit weaker and in"
00:26,"general I think over one lap for sure"
00:28,"it's a lot closer so um there will be"
00:30,"tracks that maybe you have to start a"
00:31,"bit more further back and that"
00:33,"compromises your race naturally anyway"
00:35,"yeah I'm pretty pleased pretty happy you"
00:37,"know I think it's been a a great result"
00:39,"for the team and um very satisfied with"
00:42,"that there's plenty of of uh work that"
00:45,"we got to do to improve and hopefully we"
00:47,"are able to chip away for jeda I'm aware"
00:51,"that there were some things that were"
00:53,"not totally perfect from our side you"
00:56,"know I was strling quite a bit with the"
00:58,"with the balance with the down Shi shft"
01:00,"and the the engine breaking uh I think U"
01:03,"there is some tidy up to do H before"
01:05,"jeda so I think it's it's great you know"
01:07,"we have a full race distance to to analyze"
01:09,"yeah very happy H you know uh"
01:12,"when we were at the car lunch I remember"
01:14,"telling you this year I wish I had a car"
01:16,"to to overtake and not to defend and"
01:19,"last year I spent my whole year"
01:20,"defending we arrived to a first race and"
01:22,"I am attacking and making overtakes"
01:24,"which yeah makes me happy it's been a"
01:27,"while since I've been on the on the move you know"
01:29,"it was impossible to drive properly um"
01:32,"we had big problems with the brakes"
01:34,"which we will uh investigate what"
01:36,"happened in order for it to not happen"
01:37,"again this obviously was a big issue so"
01:40,"uh yeah in the first 10 laps it was"
01:43,"impossible every lap I was doing I would"
01:45,"break uh three or four met earlier but"
01:47,"the issue was getting much much worse"
01:49,"every laps so uh every time I was basing"
01:52,"my feeling on the previous lap but in"
01:54,"the meantime the issue was a lot more a"
01:56,"lot more so I will get there and I will"
01:58,"lock up like crazy again so uh it felt"
02:01,"really bad and then it stabilized but in"
02:03,"a place that was completely out of the proper window"
02:07,"yeah it was um you know"
02:09,"made a good move on Charles and as you"
02:12,"said I thought we're here we go as soon"
02:14,"as I got into second I had all these big"
02:15,"red alarms coming on my my steum wheel"
02:18,"the engine was overheating and um turns"
02:21,"out we got the the cooling wrong on on"
02:24,"the engine and um we had to turn the"
02:26,"power down it was costing us half a"
02:27,"second a lap we don't quite understand"
02:29,"how we got it wrong because uh We've not"
02:32,"experienced that yet and especially so"
02:34,"early in the race um but then it was"
02:38,"impossible to defend so that was a real"
02:40,"shame I don't I think the podium may"
02:42,"have just been Out Of Reach but you know"
02:45,"as I said it had a huge knock on effect"
02:47,"and from that point we just went backwards"
02:48,"we at the same Pace as"
02:49,"Mercedes which is pretty much where we"
02:51,"expected to be and I think we should be"
02:53,"happy with that um a little bit of I say"
02:55,"quite a bit off the"
02:57,"Ferraris and uh a long way the Red Bull"
03:00,"but again that's what we were expecting"
03:01,"so I think was a difficult day the car"
03:04,"balance"
03:05,"was not nice uh I think the wind"
03:08,"conditions as much as they di down and"
03:10,"changed to what we thought was going to"
03:11,"be favorable um I don't really think it"
03:14,"ended up that way"
03:15,"so um yeah some things to look into but"
03:18,"I'm I'm happy with today uh it was tough"
03:20,"and I wanted that a little bit more"
03:21,"especially to to George he was not far"
03:23,"ahead but um I feel like I got the mo"
03:26,"most out of the car today so I was happy with that"
03:28,"no definitely wasn't ideal"
03:30,"today this weekend"
03:32,"um we thought we were going to be"
03:35,"closer but uh clearly not um so to be"
03:38,"kind of the same if not actually"
03:42,"probably I can't remember where we"
03:43,"finished last year I think it was fourth"
03:44,"and fifth I think if IID qualified"
03:47,"better I think that's probably where we"
03:48,"would have finished today uh or at least"
03:51,"fifth and sixth probably but yeah not much more to it"
03:55,"not a terrible way to"
03:56,"start the year I think we definitely uh"
03:59,"um had some good moments and bad moments"
04:02,"in the race"
04:04,"um"
04:06,"but"
04:08,"yeah I think we're about where we're"
04:10,"expected to be honest um it was was"
04:12,"close between everyone you know felt"
04:14,"like with with Lewis and and with Lando"
04:16,"and George um you know even L clerk at"
04:19,"one point it just felt like we'd catch"
04:21,"each other a 10th lose a 10th and yeah"
04:24,"so we're close but not quite close"
04:27,"enough to to really fight"
04:30,"um but I'm excited to see what the next"
04:32,"few races have got in store for us cuz"
04:34,"historically this place has not been"
04:36,"very friendly to us um the next few"
04:39,"races have been quite friendly to us so I'm optimistic"
04:42,"I think uh we were not"
04:43,"maybe as fast as yesterday for sure I"
04:45,"think the lab was exceptional yesterday"
04:47,"and uh uh put us on a unrealistic P6"
04:50,"that uh it was not our our real position"
04:53,"but uh yeah we we are the fifth team at"
04:58,"the moment you know behind McLaren Red"
05:00,"Bull um Mercedes and Ferrari more or"
05:03,"less as as we were in Abu Dhabi so we we"
05:06,"kept uh as we finished 2023"
05:08,"you know after a good start which was uh annoying"
05:11,"I got got off the line well got a couple"
05:12,"positions but then uh yeah thumbed from"
05:15,"behind um back of the pack and uh"
05:18,"climbed back up to 10th score point"
05:20,"which was uh satisfying for sure"
05:22,"honestly I think I'm happy with the"
05:24,"progress of the team we was able to make"
05:26,"and uh yeah beginning of this the"
05:28,"weekend if you tell me we're fighting"
05:30,"with the Aon I think you know we are in"
05:32,"a good spot but uh yeah clearly the pace"
05:35,"is kind of where we are we really"
05:36,"maximize everything the race and I"
05:38,"didn't do any mistake but just to"
05:39,"maintain L behind was so difficult"
05:42,"I'm kind of pleased I mean it's uh I'm not"
05:44,"over the moon didn't score any points"
05:45,"but you know I think we've been we've"
05:48,"been telling you guys as well it's seems"
05:50,"like we have a car that's a bit better"
05:52,"on the tires this year not necessarily"
05:54,"quicker than last year but um at least"
05:57,"better on the tires so I think think we"
05:59,"showed that today although it's still only one track"
06:02,"but yeah we were yeah not"
06:05,"quite good enough for for points today"
06:06,"so to answer your question not not quite"
06:09,"there um I've got an idea of though what"
06:11,"we can do to be better um so that's"
06:14,"obviously I have some confidence going"
06:16,"to next week but uh the first two SS"
06:19,"were a little uh a little painful today"
06:27,"oh in the end he didn't over"
06:29,"take us so in the end he just had a"
06:31,"clean air and a better pace and"
06:34,"obviously I was stuck behind magnes I"
06:36,"was just over about to overtake and but"
06:38,"anyway uh it's first race"
06:42,"um Still Still lots of things understand"
06:45,"anyway and we were not anyway fighting"
06:47,"for the points so yeah see how it goes"
06:50,"we had alarms all race we we were"
06:52,"fighting a lot of issues"
06:54,"electronically um as well as the car"
06:56,"overheating so um we couldn't stay close"
06:58,"to other cars in front of us"
07:01,"yeah yeah yeah unfortunately very frustrating and"
07:03,"disappointing um very similar scenario"
07:05,"to last year in turn four yeah just uh"
07:10,"yeah just bad um on the positive side"
07:14,"though the race pace and the deck uh"
07:16,"looked looked pretty reasonable"
07:18,"unfortunately I think it's been very"
07:20,"similar you know between quali and race"
07:21,"but you know I'm looking forward to be"
07:23,"checking the data I think that's the the"
07:25,"exercise that we uh needed to do today"
07:28,"uh check the data"
07:29,"uh compared to other cars with different"
07:31,"compounds and see you know what's the"
07:33,"difference between race and qual with"
07:34,"with the other cars um all in all you"
07:37,"know it's been a difficult weekend but I"
07:39,"think Jedi should suit our car a little"
07:41,"bit better um and I hope that we are"
07:43,"going to be closer to the pack uh than"
07:45,"we were this weekend"
07:47,"pretty much what we expected so um in terms of C potential"
07:52,"we maxed maxed out everything we we had"
07:55,"uh we knew it will be tough to to battle"
07:57,"it was not our day on top of that I had"
08:00,"amazing start but then I got uh kind of"
08:02,"into the mess with uh land spinning and"
08:06,"kind of like everyone uh bunching up"
08:08,"into turn one so uh didn't benefit from"
08:10,"the the great starts"
08:12,"I mean yeah obviously there was um an issue with the"
08:14,"wheelnut something to something to"
08:17,"investigate make sure um yeah it doesn't"
08:20,"doesn't happen again I think that's the"
08:21,"main take for me from today but and also"
08:24,"yeah unlucky with the turn one incident"
08:26,"had a bit of damage in the in the front"
08:28,"Wing so clearly not my day but hopefully"
08:30,"that's bad luck for the year done"
08:33,"uh yeah it was just frustrating happened"
08:35,"yesterday in quality happened again"
08:37,"today um so obviously need to figure out"
08:40,"the the core cause for it because it"
08:43,"wasn't fixed"
08:45,"um I think more just frustrated had a"
08:48,"good first lap had a good opening stint"
08:50,"um felt like it was coming to me um"
08:53,"struggling with pu temp so I couldn't"
08:55,"stay close to the cars ahead so it was"
08:57,"just a bit of a"
09:00,"unfortunate"
09:09,"disaster"
