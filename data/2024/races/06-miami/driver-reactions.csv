time,reaction
00:00,"it's incredible I don't know what I me"
00:02,"to say I just want to smile the rest of"
00:05,"the day um yeah it's an it's an amazing"
00:08,"feeling seeing everyone applauding and"
00:10,"cheering and seeing the whole team there"
00:13,"so happy uh I've let them down a few"
00:16,"times but I think today makes up for"
00:18,"every moment that we've had together the"
00:19,"ups and downs today overtakes everything"
00:22,"by a country mile so just happiness and"
00:26,"uh having spreading that happiness and"
00:28,"and kind"
00:28,"of spreading it with my whole team with"
00:31,"McLaren that's something I've dreamed of"
00:33,"doing for a long time and uh today I"
00:35,"managed to do it so I don't know it's"
00:38,"hard to describe like what it is like as"
00:41,"much as I think of so many things I'm"
00:43,"also just empty like I'm lost I don't"
00:45,"know what I'm going to say so just happy"
00:49,"just uh I'm just going to smile and not talk that's it"
00:51,"the base was just not"
00:53,"really there like I was pulling away but"
00:56,"it was just marginal you know so it"
00:57,"wasn't particularly good but on the hard"
01:00,"Tire it really took a step back where of"
01:02,"course on a harder compound you have a"
01:04,"little bit lower mechanical grip and"
01:05,"that then tipped it over the edge where"
01:08,"yeah we didn't seem to have a lot of grip"
01:09,"I think we did a great job with the"
01:11,"situation we found ourselves in we"
01:13,"cannot control when a safety car is"
01:15,"going to come out we stopped maybe a"
01:17,"little bit too early but I'm sure there"
01:19,"are reasons I don't have time yet to"
01:21,"speak with the team to understand the"
01:22,"reasons why we stopped early um that"
01:25,"puts us a lot on the back foot because"
01:26,"then with the safety car everyone was"
01:28,"packed again and I was in the Middle"
01:29,"with"
01:30,"much more used tires compared to"
01:32,"everybody else but we did a great job"
01:33,"managing that the start we were very"
01:36,"lucky to got out with Carlos ccho and"
01:38,"myself without any damage because I"
01:41,"think czecho was a bit too optimistic there"
01:42,"I did a a really good start I was"
01:45,"P2 into turn one and like they say in"
01:48,"the old school days czecho came like a"
01:50,"torpedo and uh nearly took a soul with"
01:52,"him uh we take avoiding action and uh"
01:56,"and I lost the positions for that move"
01:58,"uh from there I had yeah good Pace as I"
02:00,"said uh if we would have extended one"
02:02,"more lap we could have won this race"
02:04,"like Lando did because we boxed just the"
02:06,"lap before the safety car and we were"
02:07,"ahead of Lando at the time uh so a bit"
02:10,"frustrated there again frustrated with"
02:12,"the start frustrated there frustrated"
02:14,"with Oscar because he obviously run us"
02:16,"off off track and we had contact and"
02:19,"then uh I had to be aggressive to"
02:20,"overtake because this weekend for some"
02:22,"reason we were struggling to overtake I"
02:25,"I sent it on on the inside in 17 and uh"
02:28,"from then we had good Pace still the end but we was too late"
02:30,"as soon as I died in"
02:32,"the inside of Charles I could see that"
02:34,"there was as soon as I hit the brakes"
02:36,"there was no grip at all like we saw"
02:38,"yesterday with Louis um offline here"
02:40,"especially in ton one there is no grip"
02:42,"zero grip down there and um I did struggle quite a bit unfortunately"
02:45,"I've"
02:46,"really enjoyed this weekend race- Wise"
02:49,"It's been a lot of fun on track really"
02:51,"great tough close battles I mean jeez"
02:54,"going down to turn 11 up against the"
02:56,"wall Wheels locked I was like oh jeez"
02:59,"this could be a big either big crash"
03:01,"into this corner or I'm going by uh so I"
03:04,"love that I had that"
03:08,"um like in zero fear in that moment so"
03:12,"I'm super grateful for that uh and then"
03:15,"yeah just to be able to hold on to the"
03:16,"Bulls or to to aall the bull was really"
03:19,"quite cool uh great job by my team and"
03:22,"then massive congratulations too before"
03:24,"you asked to uh to Lando won my first SC"
03:28,"Prix with McLaren I know how special"
03:30,"this to get that first one so huge"
03:31,"congratulations to him he truly deserves"
03:33,"it and McLaren wow um I'm really really happy for him as my whole family"
03:36,"finally"
03:38,"very happy and uh yeah first all very"
03:42,"good job for the teams you know this"
03:44,"week uh we score every every every"
03:47,"session and yeah incredible week and"
03:50,"actually kind of we expected we going to"
03:52,"have good performance but uh the most"
03:55,"important thing is that we achieved it"
03:57,"you know and uh we sck to our plan and"
04:01,"uh I think uh we we didn't have much"
04:03,"mistake so uh yeah that was a very good job and very happy with him"
04:05,"yeah it was"
04:07,"pretty Rish race from start to finish in"
04:09,"all honesty made a good start but I"
04:11,"think when it was czecho who sented down"
04:14,"the inside when he rejoined you know"
04:16,"everybody had to check up a bit and I"
04:19,"cost me three"
04:20,"positions um and they just had no Pace"
04:23,"at all there they on in so I need to"
04:25,"check check the car check with data cuz something didn't feel quite right"
04:27,"the"
04:29,"best part of the week weekend is is the"
04:30,"P9 and and the two points uh other than"
04:33,"that I think we we struggling this"
04:35,"weekend we didn't found the setup we"
04:37,"didn't found the speed uh and me"
04:39,"personally I was not driving well the"
04:41,"the whole weekend I was just not"
04:43,"distracting the maximum in qualifying on"
04:44,"the Sprint um yesterday also I didn't"
04:47,"put a perfect lap together and today was"
04:50,"a good race but you know nothing"
04:51,"spectacular so we need to come back"
04:53,"stronger we have up and downs definitely"
04:55,"Miami was one of the downs but even with"
04:57,"that uh as you said two points we take it"
04:59,"what a race um 100 110% intensity the"
05:03,"whole way through you know from uh every"
05:06,"lap was a was a massive push and uh yeah"
05:09,"we can't be 100% satisfied because it's"
05:12,"just one point um and we can't be you"
05:14,"know we need to keep doing these baby"
05:16,"steps forward but uh looking at where we"
05:19,"were in Bahrain 19th and 20th I think uh"
05:22,"well done to the team for keeping on the"
05:25,"belief uh keeping on the motivation"
05:27,"going and improving the car uh step by"
05:30,"step because today finally we come out"
05:32,"of a of a weekend with some reward"
05:34,"unfortunately um yeah the first half of"
05:36,"the race the first stin and then the"
05:38,"first part of the second stin we weren't"
05:40,"strong enough when there was still a lot"
05:41,"of fuel in the car I was struggling for"
05:43,"grip and and balance and uh yeah we"
05:45,"weren't quick enough in that part of the"
05:47,"race VC wasn't great but then actually"
05:50,"the safety car later you know we swapped"
05:52,"to a two stop and and that kind of yeah"
05:54,"put us back on the map um some good"
05:56,"racing afterwards and uh actually"
05:58,"enjoyed the race I think"
06:01,"I don't think we could have done"
06:02,"anything different or better so yeah that's where we were"
06:04,"I think we did a a"
06:06,"very good race as a team I'm I'm happy"
06:09,"um obviously got it about that V to"
06:11,"safety car we had a strategy with the"
06:13,"leading car to uh beat early and with"
06:15,"the trailing car uh to go along and try"
06:17,"to catch a safety car um and yeah this"
06:20,"is what happened so unfortunately coins"
06:23,"uh fell on the wrong side for me today"
06:25,"but um I mean for the team it's a point"
06:26,"fantastic effort you know it just shows we we making steps forward"
06:29,"bit"
06:31,"unfortunate with the safety car timing"
06:33,"obviously um and then yeah just kind of"
06:37,"unraveled from there um so yeah"
06:39,"obviously a really good day for the for"
06:41,"the team they deserve to have both cars"
06:44,"up there um but yeah a really"
06:47,"encouraging day in terms of the pace and"
06:49,"obviously to to get a win on on Pace a"
06:53,"little bit of good fortune involved but"
06:55,"uh you know Lando had the pace after"
06:57,"which I think is incredibly encouraging"
06:59,"um um so yeah overall mixed emotions but very very happy for the team"
07:03,"yeah it was"
07:05,"actually not too bad for us but the only"
07:07,"thing is that we went for soft so we had"
07:09,"kind of uh almost 30 Laps on the soft"
07:11,"and yeah they fall off but I think the"
07:13,"issue was that we lack about some top"
07:16,"speed against Alex and I couldn't really"
07:19,"pass him on the straight so the whole"
07:20,"race was really compromised between that"
07:22,"I think entering the race you always"
07:24,"have some you know optimism and"
07:26,"obviously after the pace we had in in"
07:27,"the Sprint you know we felt like okay we"
07:29,"can charge through the pack today but uh"
07:32,"yeah it's a very different race for us"
07:34,"when we are in you know traffic and all"
07:38,"of that uh it's it's a lot harder for us"
07:40,"to use our our pace so um yeah it's"
07:42,"simple we we just can't qualify at the"
07:45,"back that's that's really where where we"
07:47,"make it difficult for ourselves so"
07:48,"obviously complete contrast you know"
07:51,"great qualifying Friday and a great race"
07:53,"and bad qualifying Saturday and and and"
07:55,"bad race but uh yeah nothing more than"
07:58,"that we know that uh obviously some"
08:00,"strengths of our car when we can show it"
08:02,"but also the weaknesses so um but"
08:05,"obviously a lot of that's on on me as well to to qualify better"
08:06,"tried"
08:08,"something different of course the"
08:09,"deciding position wasn't wasn't the best"
08:12,"so I think it was good to try something"
08:13,"different but then honestly yeah with"
08:15,"that strategy the timing of the safety"
08:17,"car was the worst possible so uh um"
08:20,"unfortunate but I think it was good to"
08:22,"try but ultimately didn't quite have the"
08:25,"Base today than I thought we would so"
08:27,"yeah plenty of learnings to take from from this week"
08:29,"I think our race got"
08:30,"really compromised by the safety car um"
08:32,"we pitted very early to try and undercut"
08:34,"sonoda um and then there was a safety"
08:37,"car a bit later and everyone that stayed"
08:38,"out really benefited from that so yeah"
08:41,"we uh I think our race was kind of finished after that"
08:42,"not a good day again"
08:45,"so um hopefully"
08:48,"uh I can get some clarity on uh on"
08:51,"things uh going forward and uh yeah what"
08:56,"happened today uh of course it's it's"
08:58,"not good um"
09:00,"nonetheless we move on and try to uh have a better weekend next weekend"
09:04,"one"
09:06,"of the most challenging races for sure"
09:07,"that I've had uh with the team so um we"
09:10,"got to look and understand where why it"
09:13,"was so difficult um it's true we we"
09:16,"actually you looking reflection we"
09:17,"didn't have that bad Pace it's just that"
09:19,"the cars behind us were all the new"
09:21,"tires so I was the back stop for"
09:24,"everyone else and um you can't really"
09:26,"hold off the guys when they're on 25 30 left new TI"
09:30,"I don't have a lot to say um"
09:32,"other than that it's a very"
09:34,"disappointing way to end um end my home"
09:37,"race weekend but nonetheless it's been a"
09:39,"positive weekend and I have to take"
09:40,"those positives I feel like generally"
09:43,"been able to to get almost everything"
09:44,"out of it this weekend little bit toine"
09:46,"but um yeah just have to take those draw"
09:49,"a line under it move on"
