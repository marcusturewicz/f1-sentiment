time,reaction
00:00,"yeah I mean uh of course we had a little"
00:01,"hiccup in in Melbourne but then of"
00:03,"course it's very nice to to come back"
00:04,"here and uh yeah just basically have a"
00:06,"perfect weekend uh the car was um bit of"
00:10,"a question mark going into the race but"
00:12,"I think we made the right calls before"
00:13,"we went into qualifying because uh it"
00:16,"definitely helped the car also today and"
00:18,"uh that's why I think I could just push"
00:20,"a little bit more feel a little bit more"
00:21,"comfortable with with the balance of the"
00:23,"car and basically on on every compound"
00:25,"every uh fuel load you know from the"
00:28,"start to the end of the race I uh yeah just felt good in the car"
00:30,"yeah it was"
00:31,"quite"
00:33,"um difficult the the first thing"
00:35,"especially I think we were out of"
00:37,"balance a bit we we couldn't have the"
00:39,"life we wanted and that compromise Aras"
00:41,"with Lando pitting so early um we were"
00:44,"then out of sync and uh meant that our"
00:47,"second s on the medium we had to push"
00:49,"and come through the traffic and it was"
00:52,"just getting harder and harder for us so"
00:54,"unfortunately yeah we just didn't got"
00:56,"the the life out of those mediums uh"
00:59,"initially the heart I think was was good"
01:02,"um but uh but it was just a little bit out of sync"
01:05,"yes it was a very strong uh"
01:08,"race H it wasn't easy very strategic"
01:11,"very a a lot of things going on with"
01:12,"Tire degradation one stops two stops"
01:15,"whether to use the new they used medium"
01:17,"at the restart anyway I think we nailed"
01:20,"a very good race with some good"
01:21,"overtakes at the end uh yeah at one"
01:24,"point in the race I thought it was not"
01:26,"going to to happen the podium but then"
01:28,"in the last team when I put the new"
01:30,"heart the tire gave me a really good"
01:31,"feeling and I could push on it and get back to it"
01:33,"well I mean I'm if I only"
01:35,"look at today I'm quite happy uh because"
01:38,"I think there was nothing we could have"
01:40,"done better we've done a great race"
01:41,"today I think we are uh we didn't have a"
01:46,"better results mostly because of the"
01:47,"qualifying yesterday and this is where I"
01:49,"want to focus which is strange in the"
01:51,"past I never had to really focus on"
01:52,"qualifying because that was one half"
01:54,"hour strength but since two race it's"
01:56,"not really the performance in itself"
01:58,"it's just putting the tires in the right"
01:59,"window and I've been struggling a bit"
02:00,"more than normally which is normally my"
02:02,"strength and I'm paying the price uh"
02:04,"today in the race by starting further"
02:06,"away but apart from that the pace has"
02:08,"been really really good time management"
02:09,"has been really really good"
02:10,"communication and strategy has been"
02:12,"really really good so uh it's also good"
02:14,"to be voted driver day sometimes you do"
02:17,"great races but you are a bit on your"
02:19,"own and nobody notices it today I'm"
02:21,"happy that people noticed it and uh"
02:23,"we'll focus on the next race to try and"
02:24,"put everything together and to finally have the result that we want"
02:26,"we never"
02:28,"had to Pace today so"
02:30,"was tough just uh trying to cover a lot"
02:32,"of things and trying to stay ahead but"
02:34,"on a track like this it's the opposite"
02:36,"thing of what you want to do um so I"
02:38,"think let's say a good day feels uh"
02:41,"doesn't look nice starting third"
02:42,"finishing fifth um say shouldn't be"
02:45,"happy with it but I think we didn't have"
02:46,"any more Pace today clearly the Ferraris were another level to us"
02:48,"yeah I think we"
02:50,"were a little bit better than than the"
02:52,"last few events but still uh we we still"
02:55,"miss some Pace compared to McLaren and"
02:56,"and Mercedes uh and uh yeah Red Bull and"
02:59,"Ferrari they are in another league so"
03:01,"yeah we're still I think fifth fastest"
03:03,"team which uh yeah normally we should be P9 and P10"
03:05,"yeah we know it's very tight"
03:08,"out there at the moment uh everyone"
03:10,"behind the Red Bulls we didn't have a"
03:13,"great day yesterday and ultimately paid"
03:15,"the price today and you've seen it I"
03:17,"think two of the four races now you know"
03:19,"one two1 between six cars on the grid"
03:23,"and if you qualify at the front of that"
03:24,"pack you'll probably be finishing at the"
03:26,"front of that pack so um it's quite cool"
03:29,"that the fight is like that it's a shame"
03:31,"it's not for for the"
03:32,"win but equally we know this um these"
03:36,"last three circuits haven't really"
03:37,"suited our the strengths of our cast so we'll re test next week in China"
03:40,"yeah"
03:42,"busy race um obviously you know not not"
03:45,"fighting for the positions that we"
03:46,"wanted to be in but um yeah just just"
03:49,"struggled I think on my side it's not"
03:51,"being the the best of weekends um I"
03:54,"think also as a team we we struggled a"
03:56,"bit more today than we we expected to as"
03:58,"well so um"
04:00,"yeah a lot of reflection and things to"
04:02,"try and get on top of next time but um"
04:04,"yeah that was uh not the afternoon we were we looking for"
04:08,"I mean the car is"
04:10,"never what I would hoped it would be"
04:12,"it's never what we would hoped it would"
04:13,"be um yeah it was uh I I got some damage"
04:19,"I think in the first stint uh of this of"
04:21,"the restart with uh shl and I had"
04:24,"massive under steer like huge huge under"
04:26,"steer so that's why I decided to let uh"
04:29,"George by because it was the he seemed"
04:31,"quicker and I just couldn't turn the car"
04:34,"and it took us two stints to D finally"
04:36,"dial more and more Wing in to get to make up for that loss"
04:38,"yeah uh relieved"
04:42,"you know uh I would say uh after I lost"
04:45,"the couple of positions in the first"
04:47,"start"
04:48,"I yeah I felt a little bit of a"
04:50,"disappointment for sure but at the same"
04:52,"time um had a good start after that and"
04:55,"I think one of the big highlights was"
04:56,"the uh the pit stop uh our team the"
04:59,"fantastic job uh mechanics that's very"
05:02,"fast bit stop and it over overtook two cars you know that's insane"
05:04,"50 seconds"
05:07,"behind Hilton so I think yeah I didn't"
05:09,"have that kind of pace uh yeah one good"
05:12,"start one really bad start um went into"
05:15,"aunti stall so uh we need to look into"
05:17,"what happened why why did that um but"
05:21,"like you say afterwards you know head"
05:22,"down I think the the pace was was pretty good for Midfield uh"
05:24,"yeah really tough"
05:27,"um we lacked a lot of straight line"
05:28,"speed so I had to do my overtaking in"
05:31,"turn six um I couldn't do it um down the"
05:35,"main straight in DRS so um yeah it was a"
05:38,"tough race tough weekend but um yeah"
05:41,"well yeah at some point I was uh"
05:44,"running in the top 10 and I didn't"
05:46,"really know I didn't have the overview"
05:48,"of what the others were doing so I"
05:50,"didn't know if it was realistic or not"
05:52,"but you know I was trying and uh I think"
05:54,"with with the tires we had you know the"
05:57,"the the red flag effectively helped"
05:59,"helped you know a few people that then"
06:02,"were able to do a One Stop hard hard and"
06:06,"I had to do a a One Stop medium heart"
06:08,"which was pretty tough so um had to pit"
06:11,"quite early for for the second uh stint"
06:14,"on the heart and um it it was a bit tricky"
06:18,"yeah I think I honestly like was"
06:21,"a positive day in terms of the pace"
06:23,"overall um yeah we did uh stop quite"
06:26,"early on the on the second stop and"
06:28,"actually same with all the others and"
06:30,"unfortunately they ended up behind all"
06:33,"the cars that were racing so then it"
06:35,"just yeah basically for the rest of the"
06:37,"race I was stuck behind Kevin who had a"
06:39,"really really high top speed so I"
06:41,"couldn't really really find a way around him"
06:43,"yeah it was it was very tricky um"
06:46,"you know we picked up some uh some"
06:47,"damage at the start which obviously"
06:49,"didn't help but then you know we tried"
06:51,"something on strategies um to try and be"
06:54,"ahead of the other cars every time but"
06:56,"we are not able to to keep them behind"
06:57,"so it was a good good for us this"
07:00,"weekend see where we were exactly I"
07:01,"think we probably progress in terms of"
07:03,"qualifying I think we did a good one"
07:06,"well starting with the positives we got"
07:08,"a great start on the first one managed"
07:10,"to move up three"
07:12,"positions second start was amazing again"
07:15,"um managed to get by uh get past estan"
07:19,"and go in between Yuki and and estan and"
07:21,"unfortunately uh did up in the middle"
07:24,"Yuki turning left estan right and uh we"
07:27,"had contact on the left"
07:30,"withan and took it took me uh all the the left part of the floor"
07:33,"yeah I think"
07:34,"it was a good start uh good first intint"
07:37,"um was trying to do a bit of a bold"
07:40,"strategy and um I think we could have"
07:42,"done it it could have worked out we just"
07:44,"got really unlucky at that first Pit"
07:46,"Stop um ended up getting jumped by four"
07:49,"rather than jumping four and uh that"
07:52,"that obviously can make a break a race"
07:53,"honestly it's very frustrating at the"
07:56,"moment with uh several uses over the"
07:58,"weekend but uh unfortunately yeah"
08:00,"there's one of the day that we have"
08:02,"another issue on the gearbox"
08:03,"so like the the back of the car was uh"
08:07,"the oil was burning and uh yeah of"
08:09,"course going around also the gear was"
08:11,"not really synced so yeah had some issue"
08:14,"in M as well but a different one but we"
08:15,"need to see to clear out for next race"
08:17,"because it's been a pretty let's say disappointing start of the year"
08:20,"yeah I"
08:23,"think it was yeah they definitely kind"
08:24,"of concentrated behind us uh everyone"
08:27,"who started on the so well at least the"
08:29,"cars in front on the medium looked a"
08:31,"fair okay but yeah myself and Yuki had a"
08:34,"pretty poor Getaway on the medium and"
08:35,"all the cars behind on the soft just"
08:38,"yeah um got us got us uh quite quite"
08:42,"easily and we were just kind of"
08:43,"scrabbling obviously for for some grip"
08:45,"and um by turn two it settled a little"
08:48,"bit but then I remember getting out of"
08:49,"two quite quite uh still with a a little"
08:53,"bit of uh lack of traction and I"
08:55,"remember an ason on my left so I was"
08:57,"kind of watching that car and then as I"
08:59,"was starting to drift to open up three I"
09:02,"uh I felt uh I felt Alex so I think yeah"
09:05,"just I saw his on board and he just had"
09:07,"so much better drive out of two he I"
09:09,"don't even know if he wanted to be there"
09:11,"but um yeah he could see me kind of"
09:14,"going a little bit sideways and uh yeah"
09:17,"just uh I think as as you probably said"
09:19,"just everyone kind of got choked up and"
09:22,"that was that"
09:24,"so"
09:25,"uh yeah unfortunately a short short Sunday"
09:28,"had a not a great start but"
09:31,"obviously a bit better than the medium"
09:33,"tires and um had good traction coming up"
09:35,"turn two uh yeah that was it really just"
09:40,"um I don't think Daniel saw me and then"
09:41,"it was just a bit of a a pinching moment"
09:43,"so tried to back out of it but"
09:46,"um couldn't quite get out the way quick"
09:49,"enough so yeah it was a a tough one to"
09:51,"take obviously we're not in a great"
09:53,"position as a team with with parts and"
09:57,"and just general damage for the car so"
09:59,"um yeah very frustrating and obviously"
10:01,"just uh just disappointing we need to um"
10:04,"bounce back and and get ready for for"
10:15,"China"
