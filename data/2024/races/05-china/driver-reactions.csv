time,reaction
00:00,"I think we improved the car a little bit"
00:01,"you know from the Sprint race yesterday"
00:03,"into qualifying and I could feel that"
00:05,"also today in the race where I think it"
00:07,"was just a little bit more consistent to"
00:09,"drive um and uh yeah I mean any compound"
00:13,"I was very happy it's still you know"
00:15,"this this track is um very heavy on the"
00:17,"tires so I was still of course managing"
00:20,"around around that to to make the thin"
00:22,"length work but um yeah it was a an"
00:26,"incredible weekend where it was really"
00:28,"enjoyable uh yeah to drive the the car"
00:31,"I had a good turn one turn two I could get"
00:33,"ahead of the Aston I could control the"
00:34,"race myself and that seemed to make a"
00:36,"very big difference today so the pace"
00:38,"was strong but like I said a little bit"
00:40,"surprising but of course to finish on"
00:42,"the podium is U is always a great day"
00:44,"good result to finish off the the week"
00:46,"with three two three places but uh today"
00:48,"I wanted more I did expect a little bit"
00:51,"more from from the race you know the"
00:53,"Sprint looked very promising but today"
00:55,"we just were not able to capitalize on"
00:57,"the on the results I think we did some"
01:00,"changes that uh"
01:02,"potentially uh took us away some of the"
01:05,"of the performance uh I think we were a"
01:07,"little bit worse than we were on earlier on the weekend"
01:09,"I think as a team we were"
01:11,"quite confident that uh our race Pace"
01:13,"was very strong however we uh yeah I"
01:18,"mean we didn't drive on the hard until"
01:20,"now and once we put the hard we were"
01:22,"much slower than what we expected so"
01:25,"that was a big surprise uh especially"
01:27,"for McLaren was very very strong on the"
01:30,"hard however having said that I think we"
01:32,"have also been put on the back foot with"
01:34,"the with the safety car because that"
01:36,"puts us in the same strategy as"
01:37,"everybody and until that moment I was"
01:39,"doing a really really good job with the"
01:41,"tires and I was very confident that we"
01:42,"could uh do a great race after that it was much more difficult"
01:45,"first of all I"
01:46,"think we need to review the start"
01:48,"because I think yeah we we had a a"
01:52,"strange line there through through turn"
01:54,"one turn two which uh meant that the"
01:58,"Mercedes and the H passed the both"
02:00,"Charles and I uh which cost us probably"
02:02,"a bit of a race time and then yeah the"
02:05,"timing of the safety car wasn't ideal"
02:06,"because everyone could put a new tire in"
02:08,"front of me and I was left with a very"
02:10,"old tire for the last thing then uh yeah"
02:12,"I had to nurse the tire home for a P5"
02:15,"I think the result is probably a fair one"
02:18,"but we've seen we know we have work to"
02:19,"do and it was good to have this Sprint"
02:21,"format this weekend we had two very"
02:23,"different setups on the car Friday and"
02:25,"Saturday morning versus uh Saturday"
02:28,"afternoon and today so lots pick through and and build from"
02:30,"definitely crazy race"
02:32,"a lot of a lot of things happened for us"
02:34,"in in the race as you said great start"
02:36,"P2 the first couple of laps uh then few"
02:39,"safety cars that probably didn't help"
02:41,"our strategy and uh make the others um"
02:44,"yeah save the ties a little bit and last"
02:46,"until the end uh we had to make another"
02:48,"stop Yes or yes so yeah that was not"
02:50,"ideal but um yeah at the end nearly"
02:52,"crashed but then fastest lap and p7 so"
02:54,"all in all I think a good weekend"
03:00,"significant um I"
03:03,"don't know how much time it was worth"
03:05,"but looking at the back of the car after"
03:07,"the race it was pretty pretty destroyed"
03:10,"so um yeah I think it explains quite a"
03:12,"lot of of the the deficit I think in the"
03:16,"first part of the race it was looking"
03:17,"okay um lacking a little bit of of pace"
03:20,"but not not too bad and then yeah after"
03:22,"the restart just uh very much literal"
03:25,"damage limitation"
03:29,"uh not"
03:31,"particularly I mean it was I was pretty"
03:34,"slow um but I mean the the the few"
03:37,"battles I had was um was okay but I mean"
03:40,"I was not particularly quick today"
03:43,"I think it was well managed well"
03:44,"controlled from ourside um so you know"
03:48,"very positive and and happy about that"
03:50,"that we that we got that one point which"
03:52,"was up for grabs you know but it shows"
03:53,"the one of the the top five cars had a"
03:56,"problem and obviously that's the spot we"
03:57,"kind of uh stld uh because of it"
04:00,"otherwise you know it's it's not really"
04:02,"possible to to race with them but it"
04:04,"also just shows that you know we need to"
04:06,"have perfect uh like a perfect Saturday"
04:08,"and quality and Sunday to to be able to be where we are"
04:10,"happy in one way and and"
04:12,"not on the other one because it's it's"
04:14,"been a really well maximized two days I"
04:16,"think on our side and we don't get the"
04:18,"rewards that we wanted to get it's our"
04:20,"best finishing position of the season"
04:22,"but you know two and a half seconds away"
04:24,"you know from from that top 10 and it"
04:25,"would have been an amazing day you know"
04:27,"if we if we were getting that so we're"
04:29,"GNA keep pushing for the next one"
04:31,"hopefully getting the points but uh yeah"
04:33,"it's a small step towards the right direction"
04:35,"I mean it was an okay race we"
04:37,"we um we did the best we could I think"
04:40,"typ result was was more or less where we"
04:42,"were and then um I don't know about that"
04:44,"SPF car I don't know if it helped us or"
04:46,"hindered us but uh it hasn't been our"
04:49,"our track this weekend hopefully Miami will be a bit stronger"
04:51,"it was always"
04:53,"going to be a tricky weekend on my side"
04:54,"without the upgrades um estan at the new"
04:57,"floor in US chassis which uh which"
04:59,"worked well and and bring us closer to"
05:01,"the point and even on my side was more"
05:03,"of a damage limitation weekend trying to"
05:05,"uh get everything out of um every any"
05:08,"opportunities and that's what we did"
05:09,"actually we we came uh 13 quite close to"
05:12,"kenb in P10 uh managed to to get some"
05:16,"nice overtakes and and good battles on"
05:18,"track so yeah it was uh there's still a"
05:20,"few things to improve um I think most"
05:22,"important is the upgrades uh work um so"
05:26,"it brings us a bit closed there still a"
05:28,"lot of work ahead of us because we're"
05:30,"still not not competitive enough but uh"
05:32,"at least it's um it's a step in the"
05:34,"right direction"
05:41,"honestly the whole"
05:43,"crowd you know as much as say I want to"
05:45,"focus like Tre this is a normal race"
05:47,"weekend but then when you see the crowd"
05:49,"from Friday they are all packed on the"
05:51,"ground standing every stage and then"
05:54,"every time you you know got out from"
05:55,"garage they are cheering on the grid so"
05:57,"all this is just get me and also this"
05:58,"journey you know to to get here I'm just"
06:00,"so proud and honored to be finally"
06:03,"having the first Chinese driver to"
06:04,"complete in the Chinese grandpr after 20"
06:06,"years so emotional of course that's a"
06:09,"very special moment for me"
06:11,"it was a constantina effect in the hair pin um"
06:13,"someone break and in front and uh then I"
06:16,"think it was like everyone kind of break"
06:17,"the car in front of me just stopped"
06:20,"right in front of me I had nowhere to go"
06:21,"um and yeah it was just one of those"
06:23,"really weird racing incidents"
06:25,"wasn't really our day um started P 17 bad"
06:30,"qualifying yesterday and uh took the"
06:32,"consequence of that today sometimes you"
06:34,"can make it back but um today we couldn't"
06:36,"the first half of the race was"
06:37,"pretty good to be honest"
06:39,"um I think especially on that Medium"
06:42,"Tire we felt like we were in a really"
06:43,"good window I think we had ourselves up"
06:45,"into a pretty good position and in a"
06:46,"pretty good place but yeah we just put"
06:48,"the hard Tire on and literally it deed"
06:50,"immediately and um just really really"
06:53,"struggled from that point forward so"
06:55,"pretty simple I got hit um pretty big"
07:00,"uh so yeah it was yeah I mean restarts"
07:03,"you got to you got to look at the car in"
07:04,"front obviously and see what's what's"
07:06,"happening and it's frustrating cuz uh"
07:09,"yeah it wasn't wasn't like a little a"
07:12,"little L tap um went right under the car"
07:14,"and then we had obviously a lot of"
07:15,"damage so we had to well we we uh"
07:18,"retired the car cuz we were you"
07:20,"obviously uh not not really driving an"
07:23,"F1 car at the end with the damage we had"
07:24,"so really yeah frustrating obviously"
07:28,"yeah unfortunate and I think uh it's"
07:30,"pretty frustrated how I how we ended up"
07:32,"because uh it's pretty pretty good in"
07:34,"terms of how I progressed until until then so but it's fine yeah"
07:37,"yeah it was"
07:40,"really sudden just lost the drive and"
07:42,"then um yeah engine turned off basically"
07:44,"and uh car stopped I don't know what"
07:47,"costus it yet but something to"
07:49,"investigate but yeah it's disappointing"
07:51,"because seemed like we're running for"
07:53,"points today"
